  abstract = {Rehabilitation providers and policymakers need valid evidence to make informed decisions about the healthcare needs of the population. Whenever possible, these decisions should be informed by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, there are circumstances when evidence needs to be generated rapidly, or when RCTs are not ethical or feasible. These situations apply to studying the effects of complex interventions, including rehabilitation as defined by Cochrane Rehabilitation. Therefore, we explore using the target trial emulation framework by Hernan and colleagues to obtain valid estimates of the causal effects of rehabilitation when RCTs cannot be conducted. Target trial emulation is a framework guiding the design and analysis of non-randomized comparative effectiveness studies using observational data, by emulating a hypothetical RCT. In the context of rehabilitation, we outline steps for applying the target trial emulation framework using real world data, highlighting methodological considerations, limitations, potential mitigating strategies, and causal inference and counterfactual theory as foundational principles to estimating causal effects. Overall, we aim to strengthen methodological approaches used to estimate causal effects of rehabilitation when RCTs cannot be conducted.}

  abstract = {In recent years, a large focus has been placed on managing training load for injury prevention. To minimise injuries, training recommendations should be based on research that examines causal relationships between load and injury risk. While observational studies can be used to estimate causal effects, conventional methods to study the relationship between load and injury are prone to bias. The target trial framework is a valuable tool that requires researchers to emulate a hypothetical randomised trial using observational data. This framework helps to explicitly define research questions and design studies in a way that estimates causal effects. This article provides an overview of the components of the target trial framework as applied to studies on load and injury and describes various considerations that should be made in study design and analyses to minimise bias.}

We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2009 guidance for industry on patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures describes how the Agency evaluates the psychometric properties of measures intended to support medical product labeling claims. An important psychometric property is test-retest reliability. The guidance lists intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the assessment time period as key considerations for test-retest reliability evaluations. However, the guidance does not provide recommendations regarding ICC computation, nor is there consensus within the measurement literature regarding the most appropriate ICC formula for test-retest reliability assessment. This absence of consensus emerged as an issue within Critical Path Institute's PRO Consortium. The purpose of this project was to generate thoughtful and informed recommendations regarding the most appropriate ICC formula for assessing a PRO measure's test-retest reliability. METHODS: Literature was reviewed and a preferred ICC formula was proposed. Feedback on the chosen formula was solicited from psychometricians, biostatisticians, regulators, and other scientists who have collaborated on PRO Consortium initiatives. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Feedback was carefully considered and, after further deliberation, the proposed ICC formula was confirmed. In conclusion, to assess test-retest reliability for PRO measures, the two-way mixed-effect analysis of variance model with interaction for the absolute agreement between single scores is recommended.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.}

Telemedicine is effective for management of chronic conditions such as diabetes but its effectiveness in primary care settings is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in diabetes care before and after implementation of a longitudinal virtual primary care program. DESIGN: Propensity score-matched cohort study utilizing difference-in-differences analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with diabetes who received care at VA primary care clinics between January 2018 and December 2019 where the Virtual Integrated Multisite Patient Aligned Care Teams (V-IMPACT) program was implemented. EXPOSURE: Patient participation in at least one V-IMPACT visit while usual care patients did not participate in V-IMPACT. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and secondary outcomes included change in the proportion of patients meeting diabetes quality indicators: blood pressure control, statin use, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) use, and annual microalbuminuria testing. KEY RESULTS: Our propensity-matched cohort included 9010 patients split evenly between those who participated in V-IMPACT and those who remained in usual in-person care. Among individuals with diabetes who participated in V-IMPACT, the change in mean HbA1C was - 0.055\% (95\% CI - 0.088 to - 0.022\%) while those in usual care had a - 0.047\% (95\% CI - 0.080 to - 0.014\%) change before and after program implementation. We observed a 5.1\% (95\% CI 2.4 to 7.7\%) absolute increase in the proportion prescribed statins in the V-IMPACT group, a 5.3\% (95\% CI 2.5 to 8.2\%) increase prescribed ACE/ARBs, and a 4.6\% (95\% 1.7 to 7.5\%) increase in completed yearly microalbuminuria testing. V-IMPACT was not associated with a significant difference in the proportion with controlled blood pressure at {$<$} 140/90 or {$<$} 130/90 mmHg thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of diabetes care delivered by a longitudinal virtual primary care model was similar if not better than traditional in-person care.}

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A comparative cohort study in UK general practice data from The Health Improvement Network database. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Before matching, 5655 patients {$>$}/=18 years with nonvalvular AFib who initiated at least one DOAC between 1 July 2014 and 31 December 2020 were included. DOACs of interest included apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and dabigatran, with the primary comparison between apixaban and rivaroxaban. Initiators of DOACs were defined as new users with no record of prescription for any DOAC during 12 months before index date. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic). Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), major bleeding events and a composite angina/MI/stroke (AMS) endpoint. RESULTS: Compared with rivaroxaban, patients initiating apixaban showed similar rates of stroke (HR: 0.93; 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.34), all-cause mortality (HR: 1.03; 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.22), MI (HR: 0.95; 95\% CI 0.54 to 1.68), TIA (HR: 1.03; 95\% CI 0.61 to 1.72) and AMS (HR: 0.96; 95\% CI 0.72 to 1.27). Apixaban initiators showed lower rates of major bleeding events (HR: 0.60; 95\% CI 0.47 to 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with nonvalvular AFib, apixaban was as effective as rivaroxaban in reducing rate of stroke and safer in terms of major bleeding episodes. This head-to-head comparison supports conclusions drawn from indirect comparisons of DOAC trials against warfarin and demonstrates the potential for real-world evidence to fill evidence gaps and reduce uncertainty in both health technology assessment decision-making and clinical guideline development.}

The Conway--Maxwell--Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution has demonstrated itself as a viable alternative for real count data that express data over- or under-dispersion, and thus the COM-Poisson regression can flexibly model associations involving a discrete count response variable and covariates. This work overviews the ongoing developmental knowledge and advancement of COM-Poisson regression, introducing the reader to the underlying model (and its considered reparametrizations) and related regression constructs, including zero-inflated models, and longitudinal studies. This manuscript further introduces readers to associated computing tools available to perform COM-Poisson and related regressions.

Real data, however, are often over- or under-dispersed and, thus, not conducive to Poisson regression. We propose a regression model based on the Conway--Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution to address this problem. The COM-Poisson regression generalizes the well-known Poisson and logistic regression models, and is suitable for fitting count data with a wide range of dispersion levels. With a GLM approach that takes advantage of exponential family properties, we discuss model estimation, inference, diagnostics, and interpretation, and present a test for determining the need for a COM-Poisson regression over a standard Poisson regression. We compare the COM-Poisson to several alternatives and illustrate its advantages and usefulness using three data sets with varying dispersion.}

The reliability of clinicians' ratings is an important consideration in areas such as diagnosis and the interpretation of examination findings. Often, these ratings lie on a nominal or an ordinal scale. For such data, the kappa coefficient is an appropriate measure of reliability. Kappa is defined, in both weighted and unweighted forms, and its use is illustrated with examples from musculoskeletal research. Factors that can influence the magnitude of kappa (prevalence, bias, and nonindependent ratings) are discussed, and ways of evaluating the magnitude of an obtained kappa are considered. The issue of statistical testing of kappa is considered, including the use of confidence intervals, and appropriate sample sizes for reliability studies using kappa are tabulated. Conclusions. The article concludes with recommendations for the use and interpretation of kappa.},

Conditional on the true propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is a popular method of using the propensity score in the medical literature. Using this approach, matched sets of treated and untreated subjects with similar values of the propensity score are formed. Inferences about treatment effect made using propensity-score matching are valid only if, in the matched sample, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of measured baseline covariates. In this paper we discuss the following methods for assessing whether the propensity score model has been correctly specified: comparing means and prevalences of baseline characteristics using standardized differences; ratios comparing the variance of continuous covariates between treated and untreated subjects; comparison of higher order moments and interactions; five-number summaries; and graphical methods such as quantile-quantile plots, side-by-side boxplots, and non-parametric density plots for comparing the distribution of baseline covariates between treatment groups. We describe methods to determine the sampling distribution of the standardized difference when the true standardized difference is equal to zero, thereby allowing one to determine the range of standardized differences that are plausible with the propensity score model having been correctly specified. We highlight the limitations of some previously used methods for assessing the adequacy of the specification of the propensity-score model. In particular, methods based on comparing the distribution of the estimated propensity score between treated and untreated subjects are uninformative.}

Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods-or developing methods related to matching-do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.}

Compared to a t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, they are independent of sample size. Thus, their use can be recommended for comparing baseline covariates in clinical trials as well as propensity-score matched studies. In this paper, we show how to calculate sample standardized differences for continuous and categorical variables and how to interpret results. We also provide a SAS macro which performs the calculation without using the IML procedure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Readmission in older adults is typically complex with multiple contributing factors. We aim to examine how two prevalent and potentially modifiable geriatric conditions - depressive symptoms and malnutrition - relate to other geriatric syndromes and 30-day readmission in hospitalized older adults. METHODS: Consecutive admissions of patients {$>$}/= 65 years to a general medical department were recruited over 16 months. Patients were screened for depression, malnutrition, delirium, cognitive impairment, and frailty at admission. Medical records were reviewed for poor oral intake and functional decline during hospitalization. Unplanned readmission within 30-days of discharge was tracked through the hospital's electronic health records and follow-up telephone interviews. We use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to depict the relationship of depressive symptoms and malnutrition with geriatric syndromes that constitute covariates of interest and 30-day readmission outcome. Multiple logistic regression was performed for the independent associations of depressive symptoms and malnutrition with 30-day readmission, adjusting for variables based on DAG-identified minimal adjustment set. RESULTS: We recruited 1619 consecutive admissions, with mean age 76.4 (7.9) years and 51.3\% females. 30-day readmission occurred in 331 (22.0\%) of 1,507 patients with follow-up data. Depressive symptoms, malnutrition, higher comorbidity burden, hospitalization in the one-year preceding index admission, frailty, delirium, as well as functional decline and poor oral intake during the index admission, were more commonly observed among patients who were readmitted within 30 days of discharge (P {$<$} 0.05). Patients with active depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to be frail (OR = 1.62, 95\% CI 1.22-2.16), had poor oral intake (OR = 1.35, 95\% CI 1.02-1.79) and functional decline during admission (OR = 1.58, 95\% CI 1.11-2.23). Malnutrition at admission was significantly associated with frailty (OR = 1.53, 95\% CI 1.07-2.19), delirium (OR = 2.33, 95\% CI 1.60-3.39) cognitive impairment (OR = 1.88, 95\% CI 1.39-2.54) and poor oral intake during hospitalization (OR = 2.70, 95\% CI 2.01-3.64). In minimal adjustment set identified by DAG, depressive symptoms (OR = 1.38, 95\% CI 1.02-1.86) remained significantly associated with 30-day readmission. The association of malnutrition with 30-day readmission was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for age, ethnicity and depressive symptoms in the minimal adjustment set (OR = 1.40, 95\% CI 0.99-1.98). CONCLUSION: The observed causal associations support screening and targeted interventions for depressive symptoms and malnutrition during admission and in the post-acute period.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regarding the analysis of RCT data there is a debate going on whether an adjustment for the baseline value of the outcome variable should be made. When an adjustment is made, there is a lot of misunderstanding regarding the way this should be done. Therefore, the aims of this educational paper are: 1) to explain different methods used to estimate treatment effects in RCTs, 2) to illustrate the different methods with a real life example and 3) to give an advise on how to analyse RCT data. METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of covariance, repeated measures analysis in which also the baseline value is used as outcome and the analysis of changes were theoretically explained and applied to an example dataset investigating a systolic blood pressure lowering treatment. RESULTS: It was shown that differences at baseline should be taken into account and that regular repeated measures analysis and regular analysis of changes did not adjust for the baseline differences between the groups and therefore lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect. In the real life example, due to the differences at baseline between the treatment and control group, the different methods lead to different estimates of the treatment effect. CONCLUSION: Regarding the analysis of RCT data, it is advised to use longitudinal analysis of covariance or a repeated measures analysis without the treatment variable, but with the interaction between treatment and time in the model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating titration of antihypertensive medication using self-monitoring give contradictory findings and the precise place of telemonitoring over self-monitoring alone is unclear. The TASMINH4 trial aimed to assess the efficacy of self-monitored blood pressure, with or without telemonitoring, for antihypertensive titration in primary care, compared with usual care. METHODS: This study was a parallel randomised controlled trial done in 142 general practices in the UK, and included hypertensive patients older than 35 years, with blood pressure higher than 140/90 mm Hg, who were willing to self-monitor their blood pressure. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to self-monitoring blood pressure (self-montoring group), to self-monitoring blood pressure with telemonitoring (telemonitoring group), or to usual care (clinic blood pressure; usual care group). Randomisation was by a secure web-based system. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was clinic measured systolic blood pressure at 12 months from randomisation. Primary analysis was of available cases. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN 83571366. FINDINGS: 1182 participants were randomly assigned to the self-monitoring group (n=395), the telemonitoring group (n=393), or the usual care group (n=394), of whom 1003 (85\%) were included in the primary analysis. After 12 months, systolic blood pressure was lower in both intervention groups compared with usual care (self-monitoring, 137.0 [SD 16.7] mm Hg and telemonitoring, 136.0 [16.1] mm Hg vs usual care, 140.4 [16.5]; adjusted mean differences vs usual care: self-monitoring alone, -3.5 mm Hg [95\% CI -5.8 to -1.2]; telemonitoring, -4.7 mm Hg [-7.0 to -2.4]). No difference between the self-monitoring and telemonitoring groups was recorded (adjusted mean difference -1.2 mm Hg [95\% CI -3.5 to 1.2]). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses including multiple imputation. Adverse events were similar between all three groups. INTERPRETATION: Self-monitoring, with or without telemonitoring, when used by general practitioners to titrate antihypertensive medication in individuals with poorly controlled blood pressure, leads to significantly lower blood pressure than titration guided by clinic readings. With most general practitioners and many patients using self-monitoring, it could become the cornerstone of hypertension management in primary care.
