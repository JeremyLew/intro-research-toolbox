  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare real-world effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AFib) for prevention of stroke. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A comparative cohort study in UK general practice data from The Health Improvement Network database. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Before matching, 5655 patients {$>$}/=18 years with nonvalvular AFib who initiated at least one DOAC between 1 July 2014 and 31 December 2020 were included. DOACs of interest included apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and dabigatran, with the primary comparison between apixaban and rivaroxaban. Initiators of DOACs were defined as new users with no record of prescription for any DOAC during 12 months before index date. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic). Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), major bleeding events and a composite angina/MI/stroke (AMS) endpoint. RESULTS: Compared with rivaroxaban, patients initiating apixaban showed similar rates of stroke (HR: 0.93; 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.34), all-cause mortality (HR: 1.03; 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.22), MI (HR: 0.95; 95\% CI 0.54 to 1.68), TIA (HR: 1.03; 95\% CI 0.61 to 1.72) and AMS (HR: 0.96; 95\% CI 0.72 to 1.27). Apixaban initiators showed lower rates of major bleeding events (HR: 0.60; 95\% CI 0.47 to 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with nonvalvular AFib, apixaban was as effective as rivaroxaban in reducing rate of stroke and safer in terms of major bleeding episodes. This head-to-head comparison supports conclusions drawn from indirect comparisons of DOAC trials against warfarin and demonstrates the potential for real-world evidence to fill evidence gaps and reduce uncertainty in both health technology assessment decision-making and clinical guideline development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lack of healthcare access to due to physician shortages is a significant driver of telemedicine expansion in rural areas. Telemedicine is effective for management of chronic conditions such as diabetes but its effectiveness in primary care settings is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in diabetes care before and after implementation of a longitudinal virtual primary care program. DESIGN: Propensity score-matched cohort study utilizing difference-in-differences analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with diabetes who received care at VA primary care clinics between January 2018 and December 2019 where the Virtual Integrated Multisite Patient Aligned Care Teams (V-IMPACT) program was implemented. EXPOSURE: Patient participation in at least one V-IMPACT visit while usual care patients did not participate in V-IMPACT. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and secondary outcomes included change in the proportion of patients meeting diabetes quality indicators: blood pressure control, statin use, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) use, and annual microalbuminuria testing. KEY RESULTS: Our propensity-matched cohort included 9010 patients split evenly between those who participated in V-IMPACT and those who remained in usual in-person care. Among individuals with diabetes who participated in V-IMPACT, the change in mean HbA1C was - 0.055\% (95\% CI - 0.088 to - 0.022\%) while those in usual care had a - 0.047\% (95\% CI - 0.080 to - 0.014\%) change before and after program implementation. We observed a 5.1\% (95\% CI 2.4 to 7.7\%) absolute increase in the proportion prescribed statins in the V-IMPACT group, a 5.3\% (95\% CI 2.5 to 8.2\%) increase prescribed ACE/ARBs, and a 4.6\% (95\% 1.7 to 7.5\%) increase in completed yearly microalbuminuria testing. V-IMPACT was not associated with a significant difference in the proportion with controlled blood pressure at {$<$} 140/90 or {$<$} 130/90 mmHg thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of diabetes care delivered by a longitudinal virtual primary care model was similar if not better than traditional in-person care.},

  abstract = {Abstract While Poisson regression serves as a standard tool for modeling the association between a count response variable and explanatory variables, it is well-documented that this approach is limited by the Poisson model's assumption of data equi-dispersion. The Conway--Maxwell--Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution has demonstrated itself as a viable alternative for real count data that express data over- or under-dispersion, and thus the COM-Poisson regression can flexibly model associations involving a discrete count response variable and covariates. This work overviews the ongoing developmental knowledge and advancement of COM-Poisson regression, introducing the reader to the underlying model (and its considered reparametrizations) and related regression constructs, including zero-inflated models, and longitudinal studies. This manuscript further introduces readers to associated computing tools available to perform COM-Poisson and related regressions.

  abstract = {Poisson regression is a popular tool for modeling count data and is applied in a vast array of applications from the social to the physical sciences and beyond. Real data, however, are often over- or under-dispersed and, thus, not conducive to Poisson regression. We propose a regression model based on the Conway--Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution to address this problem. The COM-Poisson regression generalizes the well-known Poisson and logistic regression models, and is suitable for fitting count data with a wide range of dispersion levels. With a GLM approach that takes advantage of exponential family properties, we discuss model estimation, inference, diagnostics, and interpretation, and present a test for determining the need for a COM-Poisson regression over a standard Poisson regression. We compare the COM-Poisson to several alternatives and illustrate its advantages and usefulness using three data sets with varying dispersion.}

The reliability of clinicians' ratings is an important consideration in areas such as diagnosis and the interpretation of examination findings. Often, these ratings lie on a nominal or an ordinal scale. For such data, the kappa coefficient is an appropriate measure of reliability. Kappa is defined, in both weighted and unweighted forms, and its use is illustrated with examples from musculoskeletal research. Factors that can influence the magnitude of kappa (prevalence, bias, and nonindependent ratings) are discussed, and ways of evaluating the magnitude of an obtained kappa are considered. The issue of statistical testing of kappa is considered, including the use of confidence intervals, and appropriate sample sizes for reliability studies using kappa are tabulated. Conclusions. The article concludes with recommendations for the use and interpretation of kappa.},
